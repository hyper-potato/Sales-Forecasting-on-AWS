Smart Inventory Management Using Sales forecasting on AWS Ecosystem


## Motivation
Inventory management supervises the flow of goods from manufacturers to warehouses and point of sale. It is critical for any product selling company to manage their inventory in an optimal way. Overstocking of (perishable) goods could lead to loss in revenue; understocking could lead to poor service qualities and unhappy customers. Hence, deploying a robust analytical framework is extremely important for smart inventory management.

With the advent of big data, cloud computing can effectively improve the operational efficiency of enterprises. Its convenient information acquisition and simple operation can effectively reduce the cost of material inventory management and improve the level of inventory control and management. 

## Use Case
We created an analytical framework for smart inventory management on AWS platform, which is suitable or big data processing. We used Bimbo bakery goods dataset from Kaggle to illustrate how we could leverage big data for inventory management analyses. We leveraged AWS offerings to perform exploratory data analysis and deployed predictive models to solve a business problem. Based on the predictions, we are able to offer informative suggestions on inventory optimization.

Current usage: Sales forecasting on weekly basis for warehouse inventory management using AWS

Future scope: Real-time sales analysis for optimizing inventory on a weekly-basis, especially for very fast-moving products or perishable products such as bakery items
